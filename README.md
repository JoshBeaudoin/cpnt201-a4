* I found this project actually quite difficult to do i had to look up a few videos and go over the content a lot to try to figure this one out. I think at the end i had finally figured it out i added google tag manager to mine for my custom one we had to do for this assiginment i am pretty sure i set it up right. 
* challenges i had was just figuring out how to properly set everything up and make sureit was actually conntected properly.
